## Classifying Molecules with Graph Neural Networks

Trains a Graph Neural Network to classify molecules on the basis of their
biological activities.

We train on the [ogbg-molpcba](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/graphprop/) dataset,
part of the [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu/), and
define our Graph Neural Network using [Jraph](https://github.com/deepmind/jraph/).

### Requirements

We depend on [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ogbg_molpcba)
for ogbg-molpcba.
